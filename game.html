    <h1>GAME</h1>
    <h2>description of the game</h2>
    <p>For you to understand our game a little bit better, i will explain its story. We find ourselves brought into the life of a small family, a father and a daughter, living in a small house in the forest. After rushing to see her dad, the young girl, Belladona bumps into a candle, which becomes the turning point of the story. The entire house burns very rapidly, trapping inside the dad, who managed to get his daughter out of the place in a short time. Ordered by her father, she ran through the forest to find shelter, but encounters a new character, a lost heart. Filled with sadness, fear, and remorse of leaving her father, Belladona decides that this heart will be her companion during her travel. After some time, both of them decided to stop at a river to rest, but as they were bending over to reach the water, Belladona fell into it. Controled by the current, she could not stop, and realized that she was going to plunge into a waterfall. Without managing to carry herself out of the water, she began her downfall, passing out during her drop. When she finally wakes up, she is lying on the ground, soaked in water, the heart sitting next to her. From that point, Belladona has to make her own path to reach the end of her journey, hopefully a better place. She walks though seven worlds, the seven stages of grief as we know. For each of these worlds, she is going to have to fight her own ennemies : the villains that only want to retain her from growing, evolving, and moving on. Both characters follow the river up, and will be confronted to many tedious and bizarre adventures.
