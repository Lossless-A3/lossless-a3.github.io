    <h1>GROUP</h1>
    <b>description of our group, the members. </b>
    <p>Our group is a very diverse one. Indeed, we are five very different people, some of us are very artistic while some others are more technical oriented, but we mobilized our ideas to create an interesting game. It is a two player game in 2D where each one has a different type of ability. It is a Roguelike game with five different levels representing the 5 known stages of grief: denial, anger, marchandise, sadness, resignation, acceptation and reconstruction. It will be represented through the 1st player character, the second player representing the accumulation of the grief itself. </p>
